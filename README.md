# sandbox
A repo for messing around with code snippets and side project not yet mature enough for their own repo.

## Conventions
`master` and `gh-pages` branches are not to be considered stable/safe as they may frequently be deleted or changed between projects. Side-projects should each have their own main branch and optional sub-branches named with the format `<ProjectName>-<BranchName>`.

As described above, these projects are likely to be spur-of-the-moment ideas, poorly thought-out/implemented, and likely not documented at all. Any project can be promoted to its own repository when it is ready. There is no particular criteria for determining what "when it is ready" means.

Seriously, you're still reading? This is a sandbox, go play!
